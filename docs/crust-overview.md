Crust's core functions include token staking, decentralized storage market DSM, and file retrieval mechanism. It is an application ecosystem as well as an economic ecosystem. There is 5 roles in Crust ecosystem: **validator, guarantor, storage user, storage merchant, and developer**

## 1 Validators(Node)

Validator is the maintainer of Crust Network, to be a validator, you need:

1. Set up a node, please refer [Node Overview](node-overview.md)
2. To be a validator, please refer [Validator Guidance](validatorGuidance.md)
3. Learn the reward and slash details, please refer [Validator](validator.md)

## 2 Guarantor(Token Holder)

Token holders can guarantee Validators(Node) to get rewards, to be Guarantor, you need:

1. To be a guarantor, please refer to [Guarantor Guidance](guarantor-guidance.md)
2. Learn the reward and slash details, please refer to [Guarantor](guarantor.md)

## 3 Storage User

Storage users store files through the standard IPFS protocol and place orders through the [Crust storage market](storageUserGuide.md), letting Crust network save files for you.

## 4 Storage Merchant

The validators provide node resources, they can become [storage merchant](merchantGuidance.md) and provide storage services to get extra benefits.

## 5 Developer

The developer documentation will be available at the same time as the storage market.

<!-- 
The Crust mainnet is advancing steadily, The current mainnet online progress is:

1. CRU claim -- opened

    CRU is the main token of the Crust network, and CRU-ERC20 refers to the CRU token that existed in Ethereum smart contract. The process by which the owner of CRU-ERC20 maps CRU-ERC20 to the Crust mainnet is called **claim**.
    The owner of CRU-ERC20 can claim their CRUs on Crust mainnet. Claims include [claim CRU](claims.md) and [Claim Locked CRU](claims-locked-cru.md).

2. Node joining -- opened

    Nodes and storage resource providers can deploy nodes in Crust mainnet. Node deployment process reference [node manual](node-overview.md)

3. DSM (Decentralized Storage Market) -- opened

    Crust’s [DSM](DSM.md) (Decentralized Storage Market) enables users to place storage orders on the chain, to get their data stored and distributed on Crust Network. With the backup of the entire network, users can retrieve their data from everywhere at any time. See [storage overview](storageOverview.md) for more details.

4. GPoS -- opened

    Crust’s GPoS (Guaranteed Proof of Stake) derives from PoS consensus. It requires nodes to provide storage resources as a guarantee to obtain staking quota and encourages users to stake their tokens to high-quality nodes via guarantee operation to obtain staking income. See [GPoS.md) for more details.
